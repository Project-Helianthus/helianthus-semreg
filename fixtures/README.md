# Compatibility fixtures

This directory is the future home of versioned, public compatibility fixtures
for protocol-neutral semantic contracts.

[`v1/foundation-vectors.json`](v1/foundation-vectors.json) copies the 30
foundation-relevant vector entries from the merged semantic v1 contract at
`Project-Helianthus/helianthus-docs-semantic@b16667d719defc7b0fef0400ee3ad387469018ac`.
Tests execute supported foundation properties and explicitly skip vector
operations that require the deferred snapshot, evaluation, or admission runtime.

[`v1/publication-vectors.json`](v1/publication-vectors.json) pins deterministic
publication scenarios to the same accepted documentation revision. The matching
Go fixtures exercise initial publication, patch retention, withdrawals, replay
and conflict rejection, source retirement, generation supersession, graph
cascade, conflict reconciliation, bounds, dangling references and deep-copy
isolation.

Fixtures must run from a standalone clone without private data, sibling
repositories, network access, or live I/O. Future compatibility fixtures must
identify each donor contract and immutable source revision, preserve native
evidence and unknown values, and record every accepted migration difference.
